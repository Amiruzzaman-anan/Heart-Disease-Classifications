# Heart-Disease-Classifications
It is a classification task using various machine learning algorithms on a heart disease dataset. The dataset consists of features related to heart health, with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boost, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. After applying these algorithms. Predictions are then made on the test set and a confusion matrix is generated to evaluate the model's performance. The accuracy score is computed and displayed, indicating the percentage of correctly classified instances. Additionally, a classification report is printed, providing metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
